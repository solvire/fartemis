### 4.0 Common Project Phases & Timeline

While the underlying technology differs between the options, our professional process for delivering your project remains consistent. We follow a structured, multi-phase approach to ensure transparency, quality, and a successful outcome.

**Phase 1: Project Kickoff & Discovery**
*   A formal kickoff meeting to align on project goals, timelines, and communication.
*   We will receive the final Figma design files and any necessary brand assets.
*   Establishment of a shared project management space (e.g., Slack, Trello, Asana).

**Phase 2: Development & Implementation**
*   Our team will translate the Figma designs into functional code.
*   This is the primary "build" phase where the website is constructed according to the chosen technical architecture.
*   We will provide regular progress updates and hold check-in meetings at key intervals.

**Phase 3: Content Integration & Staging**
*   We will migrate the content from your existing site onto the new platform.
*   The nearly-complete website will be deployed to a private "staging" server for your team to review and provide feedback.

**Phase 4: Quality Assurance (QA) & Testing**
*   Our team conducts thorough testing across multiple browsers and devices to identify and resolve any bugs.
*   We will perform final checks on functionality, responsiveness, and performance.

**Phase 5: Launch**
*   Upon final approval, we will manage the full deployment process to the live server.
*   We will handle the technical transition to make the new website live to the public.

**Phase 6: Post-Launch Support & Handover**
*   We will conduct a brief training session on how to use the new Content Management System.
*   The project is formally handed over, and any ongoing maintenance plan is initiated.

**Estimated Project Timeline**

Based on the scope of this project, we estimate a total duration of **8 to 12 weeks** from the official project kickoff to the final launch. This timeline is dependent on timely feedback and provision of assets during the review phases.

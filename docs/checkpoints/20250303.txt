I've created a comprehensive summary document of the Fartemis project that should help you restart this conversation if needed. It includes:

Project overview and purpose
All major components we've developed
Key architectural decisions and patterns
File structure and organization
Required environment variables
Next steps for future development
Sample code references for key patterns

This document should provide a solid reference point for continuing development in a new conversation. You can download it using the "Download" button on the artifact.
When starting a new conversation, you might want to begin by uploading this document and asking me to continue where we left off. I'll be able to understand the architecture and components we've already built and help you move forward with the next phase of development.


For the next step in the Fartemis project, I would suggest focusing on one of these high-value areas:

Job Board Integration: Create clients for popular job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.) to automatically fetch relevant job postings. This would leverage our existing client architecture pattern and provide real data for the system to work with.
Job Application Tracking: Build out models and controllers to track job applications, their statuses, and follow-ups. This becomes the core database that powers the entire job hunting process.
Resume Tailoring: Develop functionality to automatically analyze job descriptions and suggest resume adjustments using our LLM integration. This builds on our existing LLM client work.
Additional Social Integration: Add more social platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter/X) to expand the system's reach for networking and personal branding.

If I had to recommend a single next step, I'd suggest the Job Board Integration, as it provides the input data that will fuel many of the system's other capabilities. Having a steady stream of job postings would allow you to start building intelligent matching and filtering capabilities.
Does one of these directions align with what you're envisioning for the next phase?

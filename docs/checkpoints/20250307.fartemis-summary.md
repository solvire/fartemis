Comprehensive Fartemis Project Technical Summary
Project Overview and Architecture
Fartemis is an AI-powered job hunting assistant built on Django. The architecture follows a modular approach with these key components:

Models and Relationships Details
Core Inheritance Pattern
pythonCopy# From inherits/models.py
class BaseIntModel(models.Model):
    """Base integer model with auto timestamps"""
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    
    class Meta:
        abstract = True
JobBoardController Implementation
pythonCopyclass JobBoardController:
    """Controller for job board operations"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.sources = [JobSource.LINKEDIN, JobSource.INDEED]
        
    def search(self, query: str, user, **kwargs) -> List[Job]:
        # Create/update search query record
        search_query, created = JobSearchQuery.objects.get_or_create(...)
        
        # Search each job board
        for source in self.sources:
            client = JobBoardClientFactory.create(source)
            results = client.search_jobs(query=query, location=kwargs.get('location', ''), ...)
            
            # Process and store results
            for job_data in results:
                job, created = Job.objects.update_or_create(...)
                job.search_queries.add(search_query)
                job.link_or_create_company_profile()
                self.extract_keywords(job)
                self.enrich_company_data(job)
                
        return all_jobs
        
    # Additional methods:
    def calculate_job_relevance(self, job: Job, user) -> float: ...
    def extract_keywords(self, job: Job) -> List[str]: ...
    def enrich_company_data(self, job: Job) -> None: ...
    def sync_company_data(self, batch_size=50): ...
Job Model Integration with Companies
The Job model in jobboards app connects to CompanyProfile via ForeignKey relationship. We encountered and resolved issues with relationship name clashes:
pythonCopy# Final solution for jobboards/models.py
class Job(BaseIntModel):
    company_profile = models.ForeignKey(
        'fartemis.companies.CompanyProfile',
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        related_name='jobboard_listings',  # Unique name to avoid clashes
        null=True,
    )
    company_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)  # Fallback when no profile
    required_skills = models.ManyToManyField(
        'fartemis.companies.Technology', 
        related_name='required_by_jobboard_jobs',  # Unique name to avoid clashes
        blank=True
    )
    user = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, 
                          related_name='jobboard_jobs',  # Unique name
                          on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    
    # Method to link to company profiles
    def link_or_create_company_profile(self):
        """Tries to find and link to an existing company profile or creates a new one"""
        if self.company_profile:
            return self.company_profile
            
        # Try to find an existing company by name
        company = CompanyProfile.objects.filter(
            models.Q(name__iexact=self.company_name) | 
            models.Q(name__icontains=self.company_name)
        ).first()
        
        if not company:
            # Create a new company profile with basic information
            company = CompanyProfile.objects.create(
                name=self.company_name,
                status='researching'
            )
            
        self.company_profile = company
        self.save(update_fields=['company_profile'])
        return company
Django App Structure Challenge
We addressed issues with app registration in nested projects using explicit app_label in Meta:
pythonCopy# In companies/apps.py
class CompaniesConfig(AppConfig):
    default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
    name = 'fartemis.companies'  # Full import path
    label = 'companies'  # Short name for app_label
    verbose_name = 'Companies'

# In companies/models.py, for each model:
class Meta:
    app_label = 'companies'
LinkedIn API Integration Status

Created LinkedIn client implementing BaseAPIClient
Found that full job search API requires partner-level access
Implemented OAuth 2.0 authentication with scopes: r_jobs_posting, r_emailaddress, r_liteprofile
Added mock data support for development without API access
Built management command (test_linkedin_api.py) to test the integration

Current LinkedIn client implementation:
pythonCopyclass LinkedInClient(BaseAPIClient):
    def set_authentication(self, **kwargs):
        if "base_url" in kwargs:
            self.base_url = kwargs["base_url"]
            
        if "api_key" in kwargs:
            self.auth_token = kwargs["api_key"]
            self.headers.update({
                "Authorization": f"Bearer {self.auth_token}",
                "X-Restli-Protocol-Version": "2.0.0"
            })
            
    def check_credentials(self) -> dict:
        # Implementation for verifying credentials
        # Makes test API call to LinkedIn
        
    def search_jobs(self, query: str, location: str = '', **kwargs):
        # Implementation for searching jobs
        # Handles both real API and mock data
Content Generation and Social Integration

Social media integration to post development updates
GitHub commit analysis to generate changelogs and insights
LLM integration to create meaningful summaries of code changes
System can generate different content formats (Bluesky, Twitter, detailed posts)

Current Goals and Next Steps
Short-term Goals

Finalize LinkedIn client with alternative access methods:

Explore LinkedIn Marketing API as alternative to Jobs API
Implement RSS feed integration for Indeed and other platforms
Build generic HTML scraper for sites without APIs


Implement job search workflows:

Develop the user interface for submitting search queries
Create job listing views with company associations
Build relevance scoring system using LLM


Complete company enrichment features:

Automate company profile enhancement from job descriptions
Build company research capabilities using LLM
Implement technology and industry classification system



Medium-term Goals

Resume tailoring system:

Extract key requirements from job descriptions
Compare with user resume
Generate targeted suggestions for customization


Application tracking:

System to monitor application statuses
Reminder system for follow-ups
Analytics on application success rates


Enhanced networking features:

Identify potential contacts at target companies
Track relationship development
Generate outreach content suggestions



Current Limitations and Workarounds

LinkedIn API restrictions:

Workaround: Using mock data during development
Exploring Marketing API and RSS feeds as alternatives
Planning fallback to generic scrapers if needed


Django nested app structure issues:

Solution: Using explicit app_label in Meta and full path in INSTALLED_APPS
Consistent import patterns with 'fartemis.' prefix


Cross-app model relationships:

Solution: Unique related_name attributes for all relationships
Clear ownership of models between apps


No direct Indeed API access:

Exploring RSS feeds and Publisher API for Indeed data



This comprehensive summary should provide sufficient technical context to continue development on all aspects of the Fartemis project.
